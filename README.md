# Statistical Computing with R
Computational statistics and statistical computing are two areas within statistics that may be broadly described as computational, graphical, and numerical approaches to solving statistical problems. [Statistical Computing with R](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Computing-Second-Chapman-Hall/dp/1466553324), Second Edition covers the traditional core material of these areas with an emphasis on using the R language via an examples-based approach. The new edition is up-to-date with the many advances that have been made in recent years.
